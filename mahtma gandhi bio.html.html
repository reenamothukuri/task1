  <h2 id="history">History</h2>
  <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (ISO: Mōhanadāsa Karamacaṁda Gāṁdhī;[c] 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit 'great-souled, venerable'), first applied to him in South Africa in 1914, is now used throughout the world.[2]

  <p>Mahatma Gandhi (Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi) played an important role in India’s struggle for freedom. Mahatma Gandhi is known for his policy of truth and non-violence.

    Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, popularly known as Mahatma Gandhi was a major political and spiritual leader of India who led the country in the non-cooperation movement in 1922 and Salt march in 1930 and later in Quit India movement in 1942 during its struggle for independence. Known as Beloved Baapu in India, Mahatma Gandhi adopted the policy of mass disobedience and non-violent resistance as weapons against the British Rule in India and followed a principle of Ahimsa (total Non-Violence). He endured several hardships, was arrested and occasionally beaten in his journey and struggle to Justice and Freedom. However, his struggle does not restrict to India itself, as the leader played a key role in the Civil Rights movement in South Africa and secured them the right to justice and equality. His birthday 2 October is commemorated as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday and as the International Non-Violence day across the world.
    
    Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born in Porbandar, a town in Gujarat in western India on 2 October 1869. His father Karamchand Gandhi was the Diwan of Porbandar state of British India. His mother Putlibai was Karamchand’s fourth wife. Having born in a Hindu family Gandhi strictly followed vegetarianism and fasting as means of self-purification. At the age of 13 he was married to one year older kasturba. In 1885, Kasturbai gave birth to their first child who survived only few days. Later the couple had four sons. All along his schooling days Gandhi was an average stud

    <p>Primary Education
      Where was Gandhi educated? He received his primary education in the city of Porbandar. Being a famous and influential person, some people assume Gandhi was among the brightest students in his school. Contrary to this, Gandhi was an average student. He was not very good at academics or in any sporting activities, however, he grasped some of the most important aspects of his education including good morals. He was also a shy and timid student. The school he went to was a school consisting of boys only and was located on the Western Coast of India.

      Gandhi later moved to Rajkot, a city located in the western part of India. The move was necessary due to his father's new job. He joined Alfred High School, an all-boys school, at the age of 11 years. There was a lot of improvement in his performance in high school compared to elementary school.
      
      The young Gandhi who was not good at anything could now be recognized as a good student in various subjects including English. He did not excel in other areas such as Geography. He was still the same shy student but he still maintained the good conduct he had from a very young age. One thing that never changed was his handwriting. It was never pleasing. This is probably due to the fact that he learned by writing on dust using his fingers.
      
      His high school life was a challenge since he married at 13 years and had to take care of his family. His father later got ill which was added a challenge to his life as well as his education.
      
      Alfred High School was later renamed after Gandhi after India's independence. In 2017, the school was closed and converted to a museum.
